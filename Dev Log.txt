-Tried attaching scripts for rendering aim line to camera and
ball both unsuccessfully

Wednesday 25/12/2024
-Managed to implement a working aim line with Line Renderer class
-Expanded Ball prefab with aim line renderer and script for control

Thursday 26/12/2024
-Found aim line not drawing as intended, check vector algebra for possible fix
-Implemented Hole prefab with script to check for ball collision and ball stopping within it.
-Added condition to be unable to shoot ball while moving.

Sunday 12/01/2025
-Long break due to midterms, will have to catch up during following week 
-Ideally get basic implementation on gravity pull with magnitude and distance factors 
-Create game managers. Sound and scene managers are still not needed. Game manager should keep track of
shots taken and time.
