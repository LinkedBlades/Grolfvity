Dev Log


Sunday 22/12/2024
-GitHub repo set up 
-First iteration of mouse down-drag-up shoot
-Added a scaling parameter for shot strength 
-Hotspot implemented but not visible yet
-Things to implement: visible hotspot, aim line, cancel shot if mouse drag is short.


Tuesday 24/12/2024
-Experimenting with drawing aim lime
-Tried GL and Line Renderer clases in Unity
-Tried attaching scripts for rendering aim line to camera and
ball both unsuccessfully

Wednesday 25/12/2024
-Managed to implement a working aim line with Line Renderer class
-Expanded Ball prefab with aim line renderer and script for control

Thursday 26/12/2024
-Found aim line not drawing as intended, check vector algebra for possible fix
-Implemented Hole prefab with script to check for ball collision and ball stopping within it.
-Added condition to be unable to shoot ball while moving.

Sunday 12/01/2025
-Long break due to midterms, will have to catch up during following week 
-Ideally get basic implementation on gravity pull with magnitude and distance factors 
-Create game managers. Sound and scene managers are still not needed. Game manager should keep track of
shots taken and time. 

Monday 13/01/2025
-Basic implementation of planets gravity field and small planet game object with magnitude control variable
and gravitational pull based on distance from planet when ball within the gravity field.
-Had to damp distance factor in gravity pull due to working with small distances in the project
-Found bouncing ball bug where ball would not stop bouncing in the surface of the planet

Wednesday 15/01/2025
-Solved bouncing ball bug buy adding physics material to planet rigid body and tweaking the bounciness parameter
-Added gravity field to "Ignore raycast" layer so player can once again click on ball hotspot and shoot the ball once its stopped
-Still missing to implement: Check for ball stopping inside a planet and not outer space
			     Change ball linear drag when inside gravity field to X value and back to 0 in outer space
			     
Thursday 16/01/2025
-Implemented sound manager 
-Gravity code not working as intended, pull magnitude not varying might have to refrag the code

Monday 20/01/2025
-Implemented controllers as singletons
-Created another branch to keep working on Gravity field code that needed to be re done. Need surged from not being able to figure out bug which set the pull magnitude variable value to 1000 and could not be changed through inspector.
